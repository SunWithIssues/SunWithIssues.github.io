public site, for testing html pages and other frontend libraries

# Current Tests
  - Angular + D3
  - Dash Plotly
  - Flask
  - Svelte
  - Jekyll
  
# Past Tests
  - Multipage Sites w/ GH Pages (1/21/2023)
    - Honestly, it works as expected. Directories act as directory for the url, and html file names act as pages.
  - D3, simple dom manipulation
